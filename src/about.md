# About SEiN

**SEiN(Save Everyone in Need)** is A Christian Education & Business and Social Initiative for Berlin’s Homeless.

This project offers a holistic, faith-based response to the homelessness crisis in Berlin, where increasing social needs confront limited government resources. Inspired by the legacy of George Müller’s faith and William Wilberforce’s advocacy, the initiative combines ministry, Christian social education, business creation, and policy engagement to restore lives and renew communities.

## Core Focus

### Understanding 
Aim to understand every aspect of homelessness—from the causes that lead people into homelessness, to their current mindset and behaviors, and how they may be categorized into different groups. While research can be conducted from a macro perspective, this is also a personal reminder: each individual is created in the image of God and is uniquely made.

### Education & Business
Discipleship-first education that empowers individuals with both spiritual grounding and practical skills for employment and independent living. Quality matters far more than quantity—a surrendered heart is worth more than many that are double-minded. Social businesses are launched not just for income, but to restore dignity and community through meaningful, faith-filled work.

### Social Advocacy
Addressing systemic gaps—especially in housing and healthcare—by building partnerships and advocating for policies that reflect justice and compassion. Rooted in truth and prayer, this effort seeks to ensure the most vulnerable are seen, heard, and supported.
