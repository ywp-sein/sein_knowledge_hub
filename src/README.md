# SEiN Knowledge Hub

This is a shared platform for guidance, support, and compassionate action for helping Berlin homeless.

​​Inspired by [Crisis.org](https://www.crisis.org.uk) and a dear friend in Portugal who regularly supports the homeless by printing and sharing helpful information, this project seeks to create a centralized Knowledge Hub. Its aim is twofold: 

- To provide essential, accessible information for people in vulnerable situations—such as the homeless
- To guide those who want to help with practical ways to do so.

More than just a resource list, this hub will serve as a platform that consolidates information from various initiatives, making it easier to navigate support systems, access services, and foster compassionate action.
