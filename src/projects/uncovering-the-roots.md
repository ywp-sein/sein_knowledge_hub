# Uncovering the Roots

**A Systems-Level Investigation**

This project takes a step back to examine the broader forces that have led to the growing homelessness crisis in Berlin and beyond. Rather than focusing solely on individual needs, it investigates the systemic causes—economic trends, policy failures, social dynamics, and structural inequalities—that have made stable housing unattainable for so many.

➡️Current status:
- Conducting research on major social and economic shifts in the EU over the past 20 years and their impact on homelessness trends.

## 1 Core Objectives

- **Analyze key drivers of homelessness**
    - Study housing market trends, wage stagnation, and welfare gaps
    - Examine immigration, mental health infrastructure, and urban policy shifts
- **Map systemic breakdowns**
    - Identify where government policies, economic models, or social safety nets fall short
    - Highlight intersections between homelessness and other crises (e.g. addiction, family breakdown, gentrification)
- **Engage experts and institutions**
    - Partner with economists, policy researchers, sociologists, and urban planners
    - Hold roundtables or interviews to gather diverse perspectives
- **Create strategic recommendations**
    - Suggest preventive policies and long-term reforms
    - Provide faith-informed insights to inspire just and compassionate policymaking

## 2 Action Points

- **Integrate a Faith-Based Lens**
    - Reflect on biblical and theological insights related to justice, systems, and human dignity
    - Consider how churches and faith-based groups can advocate for systemic change
- **Conduct a Literature Review**
    - Analyze existing research on homelessness trends in Germany and Europe
    - Study policy reports, housing market data, and economic analyses
- **Collect and Analyze Data**
    - Gather statistics on homelessness rates, housing costs, unemployment, mental health services, and migration
    - Identify patterns and correlations over the past 20 years
- **Engage with Experts**
    - Interview or consult with economists, urban planners, sociologists, and public health professionals
    - Organize expert roundtables or small forums for discussion
- **Map Policy Gaps and Structural Failures**
    - Examine how laws and social systems (e.g. housing policy, minimum wage, mental health care) contribute to homelessness
    - Identify missed opportunities and unintended consequences in existing systems
- **Study International Models**
    - Research cities or countries with successful homelessness prevention strategies
    - Compare their political, economic, and social frameworks to Berlin’s context
- **Develop and Publish a Summary Report**
    - Compile findings into an accessible white paper or visual summary
    - Offer recommendations for policy, prevention strategies, and collaborative action

## 3 Long-Term Impact

This research will shape how we think about homelessness—not as a personal failure, but as a symptom of larger systemic problems. Over time, it will help inform public policy, guide advocacy efforts, and equip faith communities to speak with moral clarity and strategic wisdom into the structures that shape society.
