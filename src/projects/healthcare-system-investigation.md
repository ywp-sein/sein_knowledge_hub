# Healthcare System Investigation

**Researching with Purpose: Advancing Public Health for the Marginalized**

This investigation will explore how homeless individuals access and navigate Berlin’s healthcare system, with a focus on identifying barriers such as fragmented mental health services, limited continuity of care, and challenges in system navigation. By engaging with local hospitals, mobile clinics, shelters, and social workers, the study will map existing support structures and highlight critical gaps where vulnerable populations fall through. Insights from Berlin’s context will also serve as a comparative case for broader global health discussions, linking local realities with international strategies for equitable healthcare delivery.

➡️Current status:
- Brainstorming the topic
- Searching for relevent supervisors
- Having conversations with people

## 1 Core Objectives

- **Design a Custom Research Topic**

    The candidate will explore gaps and challenges in the current healthcare system as they relate to homeless individuals, such as mental health services, continuity of care, or system navigation.

- **Bridge Research and Practice**

    The project connects the candidate with a diverse pool of public health researchers, faith-based organizations, healthcare institutions, and social workers.

- **Global Academic Flexibility**

    With Charité’s open supervision policy, the candidate can choose supervisors from around the world who share their research interests and faith-informed values.

    - [PhD in Global Health at Charité](https://globalhealth-phd.charite.de/en) (​Below are referenced from the website)
        
        The structured PhD program Global Health at the Charité is a collaboration between seven partnering institutions. It aims to train excellent scientists for leadership positions in global health. The program imparts an interdisciplinary  perspective on health and a sensitivity to inter-cultural factors affecting health.

- **Drive Long-Term Impact**
    
    Research findings will inform practical models for healthcare delivery, community support, and public policy, both locally and internationally.

    - Frame research questions within the Global Health PhD and SDG framework.
- **Build Collaborative Network**
    - Connect with public health researchers, faith-based groups, and social workers.
    - Ground the project in practical insights from frontline healthcare providers.
- **Select Supervisory Team**
    - Map and approach global supervisors with expertise in homelessness and health equity.
    - Finalize Charité-approved supervision aligned with faith-informed values.
- **Design & Pilot Research**
    - Develop ethical and robust methodology suited for vulnerable populations.
    - Run a pilot study in Berlin with local partners and refine tools.
- **Analyze, Publish & Implement**
    - Translate findings into practical models and policy recommendations.
    - Disseminate results through journals, conferences, and community partners.

## 3 Long-Term Impact

Become a voice that helps shape how we care for people experiencing homelessness. Their findings can influence how hospitals, clinics, and policymakers respond to real needs on the ground. Churches, charities, and local organizations will also benefit from practical, research-based insights that help them serve better. Over time, this work can build new partnerships, guide future projects, and inspire others to combine faith, research, and action to bring real healing into broken systems.
