## [01 Understanding from the Ground Up](understanding-from-the-ground-up.md)

This project gathers practical case studies from organizations working directly with homeless communities. It helps us learn how real solutions work, how trust is built, and how to communicate with care and dignity. Through these stories and insights, we grow in understanding and compassion.

## [02 Uncovering the Roots](uncovering-the-roots.md)
This project investigates the deeper political, economic, and social forces behind the rise in homelessness. By looking at the bigger picture, we aim to understand what’s broken—and how to stop the cycle before it starts.

## [03 Healthcare System Investigation](healthcare-system-investigation.md)
This investigation will explore how homeless individuals access and navigate Berlin’s healthcare system, with a focus on identifying barriers such as fragmented mental health services, limited continuity of care, and challenges in system navigation. By engaging with local hospitals, mobile clinics, shelters, and social workers, the study will map existing support structures and highlight critical gaps where vulnerable populations fall through. Insights from Berlin’s context will also serve as a comparative case for broader global health discussions, linking local realities with international strategies for equitable healthcare delivery.

## [04 Knowledge Hub](knowledge-hub.md)
Knowledge Hub is a platform designed to serve both people in vulnerable situations—such as the homeless—and those who want to support them. It provides essential, accessible information and practical guidance, going beyond a simple resource list. By consolidating data from various initiatives, the hub makes it easier to navigate support systems, access help, and take meaningful action.
