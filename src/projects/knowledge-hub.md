# Knowledge Hub

A shared platform for guidance, support, and compassionate action for helping Berlin homeless.

​​
​​Inspired by [Crisis.org](https://www.crisis.org.uk) and a dear friend in Portugal who regularly supports the homeless by printing and sharing helpful information, this project seeks to create a centralized Knowledge Hub. Its aim is twofold: 

- To provide essential, accessible information for people in vulnerable situations—such as the homeless
- To guide those who want to help with practical ways to do so.

More than just a resource list, this hub will serve as a platform that consolidates information from various initiatives, making it easier to navigate support systems, access services, and foster compassionate action.


➡️Current status:
- Gathering and structuring relevant information
- Developing the foundational infrastructure for the platform

# 1 Core Objectives

- **Provide Accessible Support Information**

    Collect and present clear, up-to-date resources for individuals in vulnerable situations—such as the homeless—so they know where and how to get help.


- **Empower People to Help Effectively**

    Offer practical guidance and resources for individuals, churches, and organizations who want to support those in need but don’t know where to start.

- **Centralize and Consolidate Initiatives**

    Serve as a unifying platform that brings together information from various outreach projects, maximizing visibility and reducing duplication of effort.

- **Bridge Communication Gaps**
    
    Create materials in accessible formats (printable guides, digital maps, multilingual content) to ensure information reaches people across different barriers.

- **Encourage Local and Sustainable Engagement**
    
    Promote long-term, community-based solutions by highlighting local initiatives, volunteer opportunities, and low-barrier entry points for service.

# 2 Action Points

- **Resource Mapping & Community Collaboration**

    Identify local services, connect with frontline workers, and gather insights to ensure the hub reflects real needs and trusted support options.


- **Content Creation & Distribution**

    Develop clear, accessible materials—both printable and digital—to serve people in crisis and equip those who want to help, including multilingual and localized guides.


- **Platform Development & Integration**

    Build a user-friendly platform that consolidates existing initiatives and allows for easy updates, filtering, and community submissions.

# 3 Long-Term Impact

The Knowledge Hub aims to become a sustainable and trusted bridge between those in need and those willing to help. By centralizing and simplifying access to essential information, the platform will reduce the isolation and confusion often faced by people in crisis. Over time, it will foster a more connected and compassionate community, where support is not only more visible but also more actionable.
