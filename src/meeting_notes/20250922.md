## Brainstorming

### Key Points
- Building relationships with existing homeless assistance organizations is necessary to understand geographic coverage, identify responsible entities for each area, and ensure all areas have adequate support. 
- Understanding homeless people's behavior patterns regarding which parks, spaces, and stations they frequent is essential for providing effective assistance and ensuring they have access to help. 
- Resource optimization is critical since resources are limited, and the project should avoid redundant efforts while maximizing the effectiveness of existing support systems. 
- Berlin government involvement should be requested to raise their awareness about homeless issues and address systemic problems like banking access for people without registered addresses. 
- Banking presents a significant barrier for homeless people who cannot open accounts due to lack of registered addresses, and each organization has limitations on how many people they can register. 
- Public awareness campaigns should focus on directing people to correct information rather than temporary help like food, since homeless individuals need comprehensive plans to escape their situation. 
- Information will be shared through a simple website platform using Markdown Book without fancy features, focusing on functionality over aesthetics. 
- Structural organization of information needs consideration, potentially categorized by region, causes, or other relevant aspects to create a comprehensive resource database. 
- Research into existing global organizations doing similar work should be conducted to learn from their approaches while customizing solutions for Berlin's specific legal and social context. 
- Local laws and regulations must be verified, such as restrictions on where homeless people can stay, since these vary between countries and require localization of any imported strategies. 
- Well-developed international organizations could potentially be invited to establish Berlin branches, which would provide mature systems for homeless assistance while creating local job opportunities. 
- Raising awareness among both the public and homeless individuals is important, emphasizing that homelessness burdens society and that everyone has responsibilities and duties to support one another. 
- Demonstrating the project's purpose to the community is essential to show that efforts are made for societal benefit rather than personal gain, encouraging broader community involvement and support. 
- Solid action steps need to be established to ensure measurable progress, and the collective should be engaged to help with organizational precision once project analysis and action points are documented.
