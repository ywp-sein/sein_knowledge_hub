## Brainstorming

### Key Points
- Training programs would center on practical skills like cooking and hairdressing that directly address the needs of the homeless community. 
- Cooking training would focus on preparing simple food to serve homeless people, with the expectation that recipients might eventually want to become trained chefs themselves. 
- Hairdressing services would help homeless individuals clean up their appearance, as they particularly need assistance with hair and beard maintenance. 
- The project operates on a "train and supply" concept where trained homeless individuals would provide services to meet the specific needs of their community. 
- Biblical discipleship and teachings would be integrated into the training program to instill a service-oriented mindset in participants. 
- Participants would be taught that they need to serve people rather than only being recipients of help, creating a shift from dependency to contribution. 

### Action Items:
- Train homeless people in specific occupations like cooking and hairdressing.
- Incorporate biblical teachings and instill a mindset of serving others in the training program for homeless people.
